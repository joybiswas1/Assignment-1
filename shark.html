  <h1>Sharks</h1>
  <p>Sharks are fishes and most have the typical fusiform body shape. Like other fishes, sharks are ectothermic (cold-blooded), live in water, have fins, and breathe with gills. However, sharks differ from Osteichthyes fish. One difference is that a
    shark's skeleton is made of cartilage instead of bone. Another visible difference is that bony fish tend to have a single gill slit, whereas all but two species of shark have 5 gill slits. The largest shark is the 13.7 m (45 ft) whale shark. The
    22 to 25 cm (8.7 to 9.8 in.) midwater shark and pygmy ribbontail catshark are among the smallest.Because sharks grow slowly and have a low reproductive rate, scientists believe that sharks are relatively long-lived. As of yet, there is no
    accurate way to determine the age and lifespan of a shark.</p>
  <h2>Fun Shark Facts</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Sharks live all over the world, from warm, tropical lagoons to polar seas. Some even inhabit freshwater lakes and rivers!</li>
    <li>Only 32 (of roughly 350) shark species have ever been known to attack people. Like other wild animals, most sharks would rather avoid you. Sharks that have attacked probably mistook people for food or may have attacked to protect their
      territory.</li>
    <li>A shark's fusiform (rounded and tapering at both ends) body shape reduces drag and requires minimum energy to swim.</li>
